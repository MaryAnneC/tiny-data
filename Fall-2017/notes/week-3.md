## Week III: Bring Your Research (Data)

#### Questions / Key Concepts raised during reading discussion
-  What’s the relationship btwn meaning & structure?
-  How can data be parsed enough to contain all meanings?
-  In Neo4j, what is the best way to define nodes, roles, and subcategories?
-  To curate your data meansa to explain what you did with good documentation, i.e. talk through your headers and rows.

#### Review of Projects, part 1

-   Aphorisms
--  Open Refine will standardize definitions. Explaining headers will capture definitions and vocabulary for scale-able metadata 
that can be replicated
--  Hyphens can be automated
--  Visible/not links to topic / subject: consider consistency, add more columns for ambiguity (thinking maps to “no”) 
--  Clean up linguistic v. semantic example. Metadata makes your ideas / connections visible
--	Columns = Keywords = Legend

-   DSM 
--  Create a key for stable elements of diagnosis; this sets up for Neo4j or other data model.  
-- Consider working backwards i.e. make a people spreadsheet with identifiers. Use spreadsheet to contain data and upload to Neo4j.  
-- Discussion of relationships solved in spreadsheets.


- Ghettos 
--  Questioning the graph is questioning the patterns.  Graph value goes beyond visualization, beyond rows and columns.   

#### Next Week: Bring Your Research (Data) Workshop
- Demonstration of Open Refine
- Deep dive about how to clean data using Poggenburg project and others
- Discussion of steps in data cleaning
- More discussion of ghetto project.

Participants: readings for October 2 move to October 9   
Organizers: review Open Refine, plan discussion on details of data cleanup
